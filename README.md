Main Project 3 was the final code that was working when the blocks were placed intentionally with the straight edges parallel with the x axis.

Calibrate Code was used to line up the table top and camera before going to main project 3 where the actual implementation was. 
I placed the circle and square at a specific spot on the table and moved the table on the ground until they were seen at the correct positions. This would need to be reworked if the project was extended because they wouldn't have the same setup.
If someone was extending my project they may have to adjust the certain parameters in the vision like the expected size of the blocks and expected positions.

Angle Practice was my practice with being able to place the blocks (triangle and square) at any orientation. Basically I would look at one side and determine the angle that side made with the x axis.
For the angle practice I reworked the wrist joint kinematics and the vision, but this wasn't exact. It was just to get an idea.
